# RPRProject
RPR Projekat
This project should be one small but useful desktopApp for small-bussiness owners that helps updating items and its categories that are available.
It should be easy to know what items are out of stock and what profit is made on each of them. 
This project is not nearly done and I am submitting it now just to see the progress that will be made in the next month or few. 
The idea of the project is to handle the available Articles, the Categories they belong to, and based on the number of searches, how much profit has been made. 
The plan is to make another refractoring of the DAO Layer, add BL layer and make perfect GUI.
Current problem is getById method, given by result of running App.java. 
Good thing is that other methods work just the way they should and it is connected to db.
